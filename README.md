  TODO(demo-gif): record a 6–10 second screen capture of the agent doing something
  undeniable — e.g. "explain the last error", "/init" a fresh repo, or running a
  parallel sub-agent against a real diff. Save as assets/demo.gif (<=4 MB) and
  uncomment the line below. This is the single highest-leverage change in the
  whole repo for repo-visit → star conversion.

## Install

```bash
# macOS — Homebrew (live now via our tap; in homebrew-cask review)

## Why AZMX

- **Your code stays on your machine.** AZMX never proxies AI requests through our servers. Your prompts go directly from your device to whichever provider you chose, or to a local model. We don't sit in the middle — and we can't.
- **Free local AI without an API key.** One-click Ollama setup. Curated coding models (Qwen2.5-Coder, Granite Code, Llama, all Apache 2.0). Your code never leaves the device.
- **Or BYOK any major provider.** OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Groq, xAI, Cerebras, DeepSeek, NVIDIA NIM, Azure OpenAI, any OpenAI-compatible endpoint. Pick whichever, switch any time.
- **Per-call agent approval.** The agent asks before it writes a file or runs a shell command. Configurable from Permissive to Paranoid (typed confirmation for destructive ops).
- **Hash-chained, tamper-evident audit log.** Every tool call recorded locally. Export to your SIEM on the paid tiers.
- **Real terminal, real editor, real file explorer.** xterm.js terminal, CodeMirror editor with vim mode + inline AI autocomplete, file tree with git badges. Not a marketing page that calls itself "the future of terminals."
- **MCP-native.** 17-server curated catalog (GitHub, GitLab, Kubernetes, Postgres, SQLite, Redis, Slack, Drive, …). Add your own in one JSON file.
- **~10&nbsp;MB installer. Native. No Electron.** Cold-start under a second. No telemetry, no account, no email-required-to-use.

> The application source is proprietary. **This repository publishes release artifacts and user-facing docs** — installers, the auto-updater manifest, and the community contribution surfaces (skills, agents, MCP servers, snippets, translations). Source contributions land upstream and ship to you via the auto-updater.

---

## First-run in under 3 minutes

1. Open AZMX AI.
2. The first-run tour appears. On step **"Free local AI"**, click **Set up local AI**.
3. AZMX walks you through installing [Ollama](https://ollama.com) (~150 MB).
4. Pick **Qwen2.5-Coder 7B** (default — ~4.7 GB, Apache 2.0). The pull streams in-app.
5. When the bar turns green, the AI panel is live. Ask anything.

Prefer BYOK? Skip step 2's button and use the BYOK step instead. Both paths land at a working composer.

## 🛠 Extend AZMX

**Your contribution ships to every AZMX user worldwide on next release.** No CLA. You keep copyright. You grant a permissive license. The bundled distribution gets richer every month because of community work.

Five surfaces, every one of them a single Markdown (or JSON) file:

| Build a … | What it is | Where to start |
|---|---|---|
| 🤖 **Skill** | A discipline the agent loads on demand to act like a domain expert (e.g. "Postgres query review"). One Markdown file. | [`skills/`](skills/) → [`SKILL_AUTHORING.md`](guidelines/SKILL_AUTHORING.md) |
| 🧑‍🚀 **Sub-agent** | A specialist the main agent delegates to, with bounded tools + predictable output (e.g. `test-writer`, `migration-planner`). | [`agents/`](agents/) → [`AGENT_AUTHORING.md`](guidelines/AGENT_AUTHORING.md) |
| 🔌 **MCP connector** | A new tool the agent can call — bridge to your service, your data, your internal CLI. | [`mcp-servers/`](mcp-servers/) → [`MCP_AUTHORING.md`](guidelines/MCP_AUTHORING.md) |
| ✨ **Snippet** | A pre-baked prompt template accessible via `#name` in the composer. | [`snippets/`](snippets/) → [`SNIPPET_AUTHORING.md`](guidelines/SNIPPET_AUTHORING.md) |
| 🌍 **Translation** | The onboarding card in your language — 5 seeded, ~10 priority next. | [`TRANSLATIONS.md`](guidelines/TRANSLATIONS.md) |

**Plus:** add a [recipe](docs/RECIPES.md) to the cookbook, fix a doc, or [showcase](guidelines/SHOWCASE.md) someone else's work.

Every contributor gets credit in release notes. Featured contributors get a complimentary Pro license; repeat featured contributors get Teams. **[Read the principles →](guidelines/README.md)**

## 📦 Official npm packages

Two MIT-licensed packages ship under the [`@azmxailabs`](https://www.npmjs.com/org/azmxailabs) npm scope. Use them to make your AI assistant aware of AZMX, or to build your own approval-gated agent with the same primitives AZMX uses internally.

| Package | What it does | Install |
|---|---|---|
| **[`@azmxailabs/mcp`](packages/mcp)** [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@azmxailabs/mcp.svg?label=npm&color=171717)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azmxailabs/mcp) | Official Model Context Protocol server. Drop it into Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Continue, OpenAI Codex CLI, Cline, or any other MCP client — and the assistant gains grounded, authoritative knowledge about AZMX (pricing, BYOK providers, security posture, comparisons, install steps, latest release). | `npx -y @azmxailabs/mcp` |
| **[`@azmxailabs/agent-sdk`](packages/agent-sdk)** [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@azmxailabs/agent-sdk.svg?label=npm&color=171717)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azmxailabs/agent-sdk) | TypeScript SDK that ships the four primitives behind AZMX as standalone, dependency-free modules — **approval gate, deny-list, hash-chained audit log, BYOK provider router**. Build your own agent (CI script, CLI, desktop app, server) with the same security posture AZMX has, none of the UI. | `npm install @azmxailabs/agent-sdk` |

**Step-by-step walkthrough for either package:** **[docs/DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md](docs/DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md)**

**Full reference docs on the website:**
- MCP server (per-client setup recipes, tool/resource/prompt inventory, examples): **[azmx.ai/docs#azmxai-mcp](https://azmx.ai/docs#azmxai-mcp)**

## Auto-updates

AZMX checks for updates on launch. New versions land via the in-app updater — no need to revisit this page once you're installed. Signed via a public minisign key bundled with the app.

## ⭐ Star this repo

If AZMX saves you time, a star helps two things:

1. **Other developers find it.** GitHub stars are the single biggest discovery signal for dev tools.
2. **We know what to keep building.** Every star tells us "this is the kind of tool worth maintaining."

It costs you one click and supports a small team trying to build the AI terminal we wanted for ourselves. Thank you 🙏
